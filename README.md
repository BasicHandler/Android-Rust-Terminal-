Localhost Text Browser in Rust

#Core Architecture
Pure Rust Implementation: No JavaScript dependencies, minimal attack surface
Localhost-Only: Strict localhost/127.0.0.1 connection filtering
Text-Based Rendering: HTML to plain text conversion with navigation
Security-First: Connection blocking, request filtering, no telemetry
Container-Ready: Minimal dependencies, cross-compilation support for Android and Kyber Kem encapsulation for secure transport.

#Key Components
1. Core Browser Engine (src/main.rs, src/browser.rs)
HTTP client with localhost-only restriction
HTML parser and text renderer
Navigation history management
Command-line interface for interaction
2. Security Module (src/security.rs)
Request filtering (localhost/127.0.0.1 only)
Protocol validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
Port restrictions and connection blocking
No external DNS resolution
3. HTML Renderer (src/renderer.rs)
HTML to plain text conversion
Link extraction and indexing
Form handling (GET requests only for security)
Table rendering in text format
4. Configuration (Cargo.toml, .env)
Minimal dependencies for security
Cross-compilation settings for Android
Security configuration options
5. Testing & Demo (demo/, tests/)
Local test server for demonstration
Unit tests for security features
Sample HTML pages for testing
